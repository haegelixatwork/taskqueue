taskqueue
===============

Manges tasks given from other extensions

The goal is to manage every time-consuming task asynchronous in background and not in the user response.
This leads to faster response for the user.
This extension makes heavy usage of the TYPO3 scheduler.

Further documentation is located in the Documentation folder.
